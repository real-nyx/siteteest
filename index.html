            <h3>My spiritual Awakening</h3>
            <p>was brought about through pain, loneliness, and dependency on others. I spent my entire life trying to be a</p>
            <p>version of myself that others had made up in their heads. I was trying to live up to expectations that were not</p>
            <p>my truth. Eventually, I got to a point where I could only focus on the parts of me that others chose to focus on.</p>
            <p>So, I went to school, majored in creative writing, got a master's degree, and lost myself. Until 2020, when my</p>
            <p>life changed drasticallly. I found myself in a situation where I had to choose between continuing to depend on</p>
            <p>the validation of others as a source of my happiness, or simply finding it on my own. I chose to find it on my</p>
            <p>own, because if I gave happiness to myself, then no person could ever be the reason that I lost my happiness</p>
            <p>again. I know that this is not some super exciting awakening where I tell you about how my ancestors came to</p>
            <p>me in a dream and sent me on a mission. It is not the grand tale that most people expect a spiritualist to have.</p>
            <p>o be completely transparent, I was just a heart broken young adult, who was tired of being depressed, so I</p>
            <p>changed.</p>
